# Full Custom and Semi Custom VLSI Designs
### VLSI Design Methodologies can be broadly divided into 2 types:
#### 1] Full Custom Design: It requires all components to be designed and verified right from the transistor level. This design methodology can be used for mass production and to optimize speed and power. 
#### 2] Semi Custom Design: This design methodology is used where there is less time for design and fewer quantities. Here, most of the modules are predesigned and pretested. We can also add other components to it.
